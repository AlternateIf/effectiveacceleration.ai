```

### publishJobEvent

```

### checkParams

function checkParams(string title_, string[] tags_, uint256 amount_, address arbitrator_, address creator_) internal view

### publishJobPost

```solidity
function publishJobPost(string title_, bytes32 contentHash_, bool multipleApplicants_, string[] tags_, address token_, uint256 amount_, uint32 maxTime_, string deliveryMethod_, address arbitrator_, address[] allowedWorkers_) public returns (uint256)
```

Publish a new job post
To assign the job to a specific worker, set multipleApplicants_ to false and add the worker to the allowedWorkers_. In such a case, title and description can be encrypted for the worker
The function will request a collateral deposit in the amount_ and token_ from the caller.
Great care should be taken both by job creator and worker accepting the job to verify that the reward token does not have side effects, e.g. those of rebasing tokens. This can cause locked funds problem or lack of liquidity problem due to discrepancy in marketplace contract's state (stored amounts) and token contract's state (actual balance).
This contract does not try to solve the potential problem of job creator and arbitrator colluding to profit from the worker. Platform users bare the responsibility of choosing the arbitrators and working with them.
Maintaining a whitelist of trusted tokens and/or arbitrators does not appear to be a solution for two possible problems mentioned above for this marketplace, as it would empair the freedom of choice of the platform users and would require further maintenance work from contract owner/governing group.

#### Parameters

| title_ | string | job title - must be not null |
| contentHash_ | bytes32 | short job description published on IPFS |
| multipleApplicants_ | bool | do you want to select from multiple applicants or let the first one take the job? |
| tags_ | string[] | labels to help the workers search for the job. Each job must have exactly one of the labels listed above, and any number of other labels |
| token_ | address | token in which you prefer to pay the job with - must be a valid ERC20 token, e.g. WETH |
| amount_ | uint256 | expected amount to pay for the job - must be greater than 0 |
| maxTime_ | uint32 | maximum expected time (in sec) to deliver the job - must be greater than 0 |
| deliveryMethod_ | string | preferred method of delivery (e.g. "IPFS", "Courier") |
| arbitrator_ | address | address of an arbitrator preferred by the customer |
| allowedWorkers_ | address[] | list of workers that can apply for the job. Leave empty if any worker can apply |

### refuseArbitration

```solidity
function refuseArbitration(uint256 jobId_) public
```

If an arbitrator has been included in a job they're not comfortable with, they can remove themselves.
If the job has been started and paid into the escrow, the escrow will be fully refunded
TBD: we discussed that the in this case, the arbitrator fee should be refunded as well so t hat the arbitrator doesn't keep
     funds from potentially illicit transactions. However, perhaps it might be better for the arbitrator to keep the fee to prevent spam?
